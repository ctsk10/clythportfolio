      <h1>Reduce plastic waste</h1>
      <p>Plastic waste is an big issue in the world as space is running out to burn them.<p> <br>In this article, I talk about the reasons why we should stop consuming so much plastic in our daily lives.</br> Read more about it below</p>
      <p> I am currently trying to develop an app to help people reduce their plastic waste. Here are my reasons why I believe that people should use my app.</p/> 
<p> Plastics are being consumed in large quantities daily.  According to a study published by Roland Geyer and colleagues in the journal Science Advances, 6.3 out of the 8.3 billion metric tons of waste produced are plastic waste. There are immense environmental consequences arising from this excessive consumption of plastic. What then happens to these plastics? There are two ways to treat used plastics - burying them in landfills or burning them - each with environmental consequences. A tiny piece of plastic takes hundreds of years to break down, so many countries store used plastics in landfills. As more space gets taken up for storing plastic waste, the usage of land is not optimized. Alternatively, plastic waste can be burnt.  However, burning plastic releases toxins that harm the environment and threaten vegetation, human and animal health. The burning of plastics also contributes to global warming. This causes the sea level to rise by 3.2 mm annually, thereby threatening low lying cities such as Osaka, Shanghai and Hong Kong.</p> 

<p>I hope to develop a mobile phone app that can help individuals become aware of the amount of plastic that they are using. In this way, they can consciously reduce their plastic consumption. This is especially important as the world is facing unprecedented environmental challenges such as global warming, rising sea levels and air pollution.</p>   

<p> One of the reasons why individuals are overusing plastic is because they may not be aware that the amount of plastic that they use at an individual level when aggregated will have an immense adverse impact on the environment. With my app, individuals can get tips on how to minimize plastic waste and they can start to take active steps to save the earth. Use the app for a plastic-free Earth. </p></p>

        <p>Although I use a lot of plastic myself, I am shocked that we use a lot of plastic waste every year. When I go to a beach, I would always find little bits of plastic being washed up by the sea. I always find areas of beaches where I have to literally tiptoe in order to cross the section.</p>
