          This is a personal computer 
      </div>
        <p> The personal computer has revolutionized the way people interact,work and play. It can help you with homework, you can play games on it and you can easily find out information that you need. Or, you can book that next cool holiday all done from that nifty and clever deavice. Let's find out more about this amazing machine. 
        <h1>The History of Computers</h1>
        <p> In 1833, a man by the name of Charles Babbage invented all the parts that are now used for a modern computer. However, it was Konrad Zuse who was the inventor of the first computer in the world in 1936 and he named it the Z1. In 1939, he created the Z2 as the first electro-mechanical computer. These early computers were made in the 1940s. They were around the size of a large room and they used heaps of electricity. Computers as we know them today, were only started being made in 1980.
        <h1> What do Computers do?</h1>
        <p> Modern computers are very powerful machines. They have something called a microprocessor that can make billions of calculations every second. They also have a memory, or what is referred to as RAM. This stores all the information you need when youâ€™re not using it. Most people have used a personal computer in their home or at work. A person can control a computer by telling it to do things. Some ways of controlling a computer are with a keyboard, mouse, buttons, touch screen. Some very new computers can also be controlled with voice commands or hand gestures. In homes, computers are used for things such as listening to music, reading the news, and writing.  </p>  
        <h1> The Internet </h1>
        <p> The Internet is the thing that lets people communicate between their computers. One of the most important jobs that computers do for people is helping with communication. Computers have helped people move forward in science, medicine, business, and learning, because they let experts from anywhere in the world work with each other and share information. They also let other people communicate with each other, do their jobs almost anywhere, learn about almost anything, or share their opinions with each other. </p>

        <p>1. The first personal computer's mouse was made out of wood.</p>
        <p>2. There are about 5000 computer viruses that are released every month.</p>
        <p>3. HP, Microsoft and Apple have one very interesting thing in common: they were all started in a garage.</p>
        <p> 4. An average person normally blinks 20 times a minute, but when using a computer, that person only blinks 7 times a minute.</p>
        <p>5. More than 80% of the emails sent daily are spams.</p>
        <p>6. TYPEWRITER - this is the longest word that you can type only using first row of letters on your keyboard.</p>
        <h1> What the world will be like without the invention of personal computers.</h1>
        <p>Without this invention, more people will wear spectacles as they rely on smaller screens, such as the mobile phone to send messages to one another, or do their work. This will mean that a lot of people will have different eye problems. This is not good as if everyone wears spectacles, more people have the possibility of going blind. There will be high demand for spectacles, and more spectacle shops will open, there will be less money for all and more buisnesses will have to shut down. This also means that the world will have less resources to make other objects that require the same materials that spectacles require. </p>
